Agent Nishant… you are awake.

For decades you have slept in cryogenic stasis, part of a mission that began with a hundred of the bravest souls. One by one, they vanished into the void.

In a universe stitched together by glowing blueprints and drifting constellations, there exists a realm unseen by ordinary eyes. 

Legends speak of an ancient force—the Thread of Connection—that links hearts, memories, and worlds. Many have tried to follow it, yet all have failed.

You, Nishant, awaken as the chosen adventurer. The stars themselves pulse in rhythm with your heartbeat, and the glowing nodes beckon you forward. Each challenge you face will test your logic, patience, and perception. Each puzzle solved will reveal fragments of a story… our story.

As you journey through the realms of logic and light, remember: every path, every constellation, every glowing blueprint holds a secret. Solve them, follow the thread, and at the end of this adventure, you will uncover a truth written among the stars… a truth that may save the planet you call home.`;

You've broken the puzzle. The thread has been found and the truth uncovered. Our years of effort have led to this.

Dear Nishant,

This took me a lot of time admittedly (vibecoded as fuck tho) but none of it compares to the joy of being with you. You're 25 and that's so old but don't worry because I will love this version of you as much as I have loved you at 24, 23 and 22. 

There are versions of you that I've seen - some great, some good and others not so much - but despite seeing all of those, I think I am in it for the long haul. I love watching you grow up and change in ways I never thought you would, you teach me as much as I teach you and even though, we bicker, I always come back home to you. In the past year, you've changed so much - there hasn't been great days; we've had some of our worst fights but the only reason we made it across is
because you make me feel so loved and safe. It is assuring to know that every crisis can be managed by you and every thing I am too lazy to do can be handed off to you. You've grown hotter, funnier and definitely more of an empath than I would've thought possible.

Spending time with you is one of my favorite things ever - we are a self-regulating machine, two peas in a pod esque situation because I feel less alone with you than I do in a crowd of 24. I never thought there would be people I feel so comfortable with you - you were never on the list - I am so grateful for the 
trip that led me to you. To feel so understood, reassured, hot, confident and funny just by being in your presence is a great feeling, I must admit.

It has been the world's most exciting rollercoaster and I never want to get off it. 

Baba is 25 is an ode to everything you love - all these puzzles, games and chess moves I don't understand make up who you are. Heavily inspired from the games I often see you play, this is my way of saying that although your world looks a bit different to mine, I will never not make an effort to understand you.
I hope you like playing this game as much I enjoyed making it.

Happy Birthday so much, I love you further than the stars and beyond the moon.
